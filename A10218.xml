            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing wee all haue receiued, and allow it for truth, That the ignorance of the Law doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe none of offence; and alſo, That the Law doth helpe the watchfull, and not the ſlothfull man: therefore it behoueth each perſon, firſt to ſeeke the knowledge of thoſe Lawes vnder which he doth liue, and whereby he is to receiue benefit, or to ſuſtaine perill, and next, with al induſtry to frame his obedience vnto them, or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſubmit himſelfe to the cenſure of them. And though wee find by experience, that ſome men by the ſluggiſhneſſe of their natures, others by the careleſneſſe of their owne welfares, and a third ſort wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to pleaſures and vanities, do little reſpect to know, and leſſe to obey our criminall &amp; capitall Laws, being things of great moment and importance, and therfore doe ofttimes taſt the ſmart of them, and repent their follies when it is too late: Notwithſtanding, for that there be many others which do endeuour to read them, and imploy their industrie to conceiue them; ſome for the increaſe of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, others, in their actions to be directed by them, and many for the eſchewing of the penalties of them, &amp; yet do not wholly addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſtudie of the Law: therefore, as neere as I can, to ſatisfie the deſires, and to giue contentment to al the perſons aforeſaid, I haue done my endeuor in this Treatiſe, to lay open to all them that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to read, and thereby to know, which be the offences that the Law doth in generall tearmes condemne, and do moſt tend to the breach or blemiſh of the peace of the Realme, and to the diſlike of all the good
<pb facs="tcp:16540:4"/> members thereof, and what puniſhments ſhe hath impoſed vpon the tranſgreſſors therein, and by whom, &amp; in what maner to be inflicted. If one man do pretend title vnto, &amp; ſue to recouer any land, leaſe, or goods of anothers, all ſtrangers ſtand indifferent, and meddle no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but onely wiſh well to him that hath the beſt title, &amp; deſire that iuſtice may be done, and right may preuaile: but if a Treaſon, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Burglarie, Robberie, Theft, notorious Riot, Forgerie, Periurie, Extortion, or Oppreſsion be committed, then each man in conceit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it his owne caſe, &amp; doth in a ſort take it to bee done to himſelfe; and all perſons generally do find fault with the tranſgreſſors therein, they exclaime of them, condemne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in their hearts cry <hi>Crucifige</hi> vpon them. And therefore the crimes aforeſaid, &amp; ſuch like, may bee tearmed generall offences, partly, for that they do redownd to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall diſlike of all the good members of the realm; and partly for that they tend to the breach or blemiſh of the peace, being a thing generally imbraced or wiſhed for, &amp; which the king &amp; all his good ſubiects are bound, and in a ſort haue vndertaken to maintaine: and therefore as the king hath an intereſt in them, or iuriſdiction ouer them all, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the offendors in them, as tranſgreſſors of his lawes, and diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his peace, and people, ſo hath euery other well gouerned mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Commonweale, a care and regard of them, foreſeeing that he may receiue the like wrong, and tast the ſame abuſe, by the ſaid, or other ſuch malefactors meanes; and for that cauſe doth proclaime o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen warre againſt them, and is as deſirous to root them out, as the husbandman his thiſtles out of his good corne, or the gardner his net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles from his ſweet flowers. Wherefore, ſeeing a guiltie perſon in any of the crimes aforeſaid, is perſecuted, in deed, or conſent, by all wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing well to the Weale-publique, or their owne priuat eſtates: it is requiſit that good men which eſchew to offend for the loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and euill men, which feare to offend for the dread of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould both know thoſe lawes which they are to make vſe of, and the penalties which be threatned to the infringers thereof, to the intent that the good man hauing a will to ſtand, may trust to his feet, remaine firme, and continue his integritie; and the euill minded man beginning to ſtagger, may bend his endeuour to ſtay, and ſlide no further. All which by this worke (good Reader) I labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, to the intent, that the well meaning man being made the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:16540:4"/> and he that before was lewdly diſpoſed, the leſſe hurtfull, may both at the last meet and ioyne in ſeeking and furtherance of that peace which will be comfortable to the King and Realme, and pleaſing both to God and man. The question may be asked me, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intitle my Booke, <hi>De pace Regis &amp; Regni,</hi> and yet do chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make mention therein, of thoſe crimes which doe moſt disturbe the peace of the King and the kingdome, and ſo make the Booke and the title as it were <hi>oppoſitum in ſubiecto?</hi> Whereunto I anſwer, That the peace whereof I do write, is not obtained by the ſaid offences committed, but by the lawes that do puniſh or reſtraine them, which lawes alſo I haue ſet downe at large in this Treatiſe, being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall marke that I deſire the Reader to behold: As, many Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue written large volumes of ſeuerall infirmities in mans bodie, and then expreſſed which bee the Medicines to cure them; not to the intent to allure the Reader to ſeeke the diſeaſe, but how to preuent it before he hath it; or how to be rid of it when he hath taken it. And ſeuerall Diuines haue compoſed whole Tomes, of Pride, Malice, Couetouſneſſe, and ſuch like offences, not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to intice the fraile man to fall into them, but to ſhew the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of them, how grieuous they bee in Gods ſight, and how hee hath threatned deepely to plague the offendors therein, to the end they might dehort and diſcourage tranſgreſſors from them, and might allure and winne them to humilitie, forgiueneſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, charitie, repentance, and other vertues. And ſo I name my Booke of the quiet euent, and not of the perſecuting cauſe; of the patient cured, and not diſeaſed; of the ſinner reclaimed, and not perſisting in vice; of that peace which I would haue, and wiſh might flouriſh, and not of thoſe Lawes that by awe do worke it. For theſe Lawes whereof I doe write, and ſome others,<note place="margin">How the Lawes doe preſerue the peace of the King.</note> doe preſerue the peace of the King, in that they doe aſſure vs who is our King, doe ſettle and continue the Crowne on his head, do put the Sword and Scepter in his hand, doe attribute to him ſeuerall Regall Titles, Honours, and Prerogatiues, doe bind his Subiects to performe all loyaltie, duetie, and obedience vnto him, and lay heauie puniſhments vpon the withſtanders or deniers thereof. Theſe Lawes bee as his Priuie Counſellours, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly reſpecting the preſeruation of his perſon, peace, Crowne,
<pb facs="tcp:16540:5"/> and dignitie: Theſe be as his Gentlemen Pentioners, attending daily in his preſence, to do him all princely honor and ſeruice: Theſe bee as the Yeomen of his guard, waiting day and night to protect his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in peace, from all forcible aſſaults, and other perils: Theſe bee as his great and goodly Shippes, which lye houering on the Seas, and his ſtrong caſtles and forts of defence, which ſtand firmly vpon the land, wherewith he doth preuent forrein hoſtilitie, repreſſe inward tumults, and ſo keep himſelf and his people in peace: Theſe be as the Iudges, Iustices, Sherifes, Conſtables, and other Officers, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching euerie houre and moment in all the Shires, places, corners, and creekes of the Realme, to repreſſe outrages, and to maintain his peace: And laſtly, theſe be to him as his mynt, by which he doth coyn gold and ſiluer to defend himſelfe and his people in the time of warre, and to ſupport his honour and royall eſtate in the time of peace.<note place="margin">How the Lawes doe preſerue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie perſon in peace.</note> And alſo by the protection of theſe Lawes euerie good member of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth receiue the like benefit of peace: for in feare of them each perſon doth enioy his life and limmes in peace, and is defended from the bloudie minded murderer, and manqueller, and the rage of the furious quareller and fighter: And in feare of them the houſekeeper reſteth in peace, with his wife and family vnder his owne roof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being aſſaulted by burglers: And in feare of them the traueller iournieth in peace from one country to another, without being ſpoiled by robbers: And in feare of them the Graſiers cattell do feed quietly in his paſture, without being ſtolne by theeues. The terrour of the Lawes do ofttimes reſtraine cholericke or contentious ſpirits from Batteries, Riots, Routs, Forcible entries, and other outrages; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous and greedy perſons, from practiſing or procuring of forgeries; and godleſſe and irreligious people, from perſuading or committing of periuries; and falſe and guilefull perſons, from putting in vre of frauds and deceits; and impudent and ſhameleſſe men, to wreſt from others by briberie, extortion, or oppreſsion. And diuers there be, who neither by the lawes of God, of nature, or reaſon, will be bridled and reduced to vertue, yet by the penalties &amp; feare of ſome of our capital and criminal laws, do yeeld to be curbed, &amp; refrain from the practiſe of their vicious liues, of whom the ſaying of the Poet may be verified, <hi>Oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae.</hi> And ſo I may truly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, that the Lawes whereof I do write, be the meanes of the peace
<pb facs="tcp:16540:5"/> of the K. and the kingdom: And ſo long as the offences in this Treatiſe ſpecified ſhall be reformed, or duely checked by theſe Lawes, <hi>Florebit pax Regis &amp; Regni.</hi> But though peace be mine end, and peace the marke that I roue at, yet there be ſome that thinke, that the diuulging of our criminall and capitall Laws, in our mother tongue, will not be a meane of that peace which I do ſo much ayme at, for that, as they ſurmiſe, the ſame Lawes may then be miſconſtrued by euerie ignorant and vnlearned perſon, that can read Engliſh, and the ſence and meaning thereof may be mistaken, the reader himſelfe may be led into errour, and others may be miſinformed by his imbecilitie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing the ſame reader is able only to looke into the letter of the law, and not to diſcerne of the intent of the makers, or of the true ſence thereof: And do alledge for their reaſon, the ſame that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected at the making of the Statute of <hi>Ann<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 34.

               <note place="margin">Cratippus.</note> Many wholly deuoted to their owne opinions, do deſire to maintaine Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, &amp; to ſtrain all their wits to defend them, though their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeeme neuer ſo improbable, and their arguments neuer ſo weak to others: as appeareth by <hi>Rodolphus Agricola,</hi> who did write a book <hi>De vanitate ſcientiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which the whole wiſdome of the world in all ages hath ſo much admired and honoured: and by <hi>Eraſmus Roterodamus,</hi> who compiled a Treatiſe <hi>Of the prayſe of folly,</hi> attempting therein, to proue by a farre fetched argument, that the folly of man and woman together, is the onely cauſe of the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and continuance of mankind vpon the face of the earth, and that
<pb facs="tcp:16540:7"/> the fault and folly of <hi>Adam</hi> in eating of the forbidden apple, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Gods commaundement, being the breach of the peace betweene God and man, was the cauſe that moued Ieſus Chriſt the ſon of God, to deſcend from the boſome of his father, to take fleſh of the bleſſed virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> to ſuffer his paſsion for the ſinnes of man, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new peace betweene God and man.

The menacer layeth open his name, &amp; his grief, and ſtandeth in the face of his enemy, &amp; diſcouereth the coraſiue of his mind, &amp; doth thereby giue a forewarning to his aduerſarie to prouide for, &amp; defend himſelfe: But this ſecret canker the libeller, concealeth his name, hideth himſelfe in a corner, &amp; priuily ſtingeth him in fame, reputation, &amp; credit, who then neither knoweth from whom, or vpon what cauſe he receiueth his blows, nor yet hath means therin to defend himſelfe. And whether this libelling,<note place="margin">Co. li. 5.125</note> ſecret ſlandering or defaming,<note place="margin">The enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of priuie defaming and libelling.</note> be againſt a publike magiſtrat, or a priuat perſon, yet it may tend to the breach of the peace, to the raiſing of quarels, &amp; effuſion of blood, &amp; ſo may be a ſpeciall impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that peace which all good policie endeuoreth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.

And if it be but againſt a priuat perſon, yet ſeeing that a libel, or other note of infamie, is inuented to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him, to tread his honor &amp; eſtimation in the duſt, to extirpate and root out his reputation &amp; credit from the face of the earth, to make him a ſcorne to his enemies, &amp; to be derided &amp; deſpiſed by his neighbors, it doth greatly kindle the wrath of him, &amp; of ſuch as be of his kindred, alliance, &amp; true friendſhip, &amp; vrge them to reuenge: whereupon do ofttimes enſue grudges, quarels, fraies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, &amp; manſlaughters. Sometimes the malicious defamor powreth out his venim in writing, by a ſcandalous booke, ballad, epigram, or rime, either in mitre or proſe: ſome other times by ſons, ſcofs, ieſts, or taunts: &amp; diuers times by hanging of pictures of reproach, ſigns of ſhame, or tokens of diſgrace, néer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where the party therby traduced doth moſt conuerſe: as the picture of the gallowes, pillorie, cucking ſtoole, hornes, or other ſuch like. In which caſes the law hath prouided, that the partie delinquent, when he is found out &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, ſhalbe ſharply puniſhed: for he may either be indicted for the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

            <p n="2">2 As the ſaid Lawes &amp; Statutes were deuiſed in ſeueral ages by the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Realme, to enquire of, and reſtraine Riots, Routs, vnlawfull, and rebellious aſſemblies, and to checke violences, and forces, before they ſhould grow to a head: So haue our prouident forefathers erected the moſt honorable Court of Starre chamber,<note place="margin">The Court of Starre cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to puniſh Riots, &amp;c.</note> to examine and puniſh thoſe, and other offences, when they breake out to extremities, <hi>viz.</hi> to great and haynous Riots, or ſuch like enormities, thereby to kéepe euery perſon in awe, and ſo the whole Realme in peace. As appeareth by the Statute of <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. whereby it is inacted, That the Chauncellour, and Treaſorer of England for the time being (and the Preſident of the Kings Councell,<note place="margin">St. 3.

And though the Iuſtices of peace doe aſſeſſe a fine in the Country vpon ſome that haue committed a Riot there, yet the Lords in the Starre chamber, may aſſeſſe vpon the ſaid offendrs for the ſame Riot, a greater penalty, if they ſée cauſe; for in this caſe the offendors be not twice puniſhed for one offence, but part of the due puniſhment is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16540:31"/> at one time, and part at another: And the Lords doe ſufficiently puniſh an offence, which was but remiſly done by the Iuſtices.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A Riot is where thrée perſons or aboue do aſſemble themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the intent to beate or maihem a man, to pul downe a houſe, wall, pale,<note place="margin">What is a Riot.</note> hedge, or ditch wrongfully, to claime or take common or way in a ground, to deſtroy any parke, warren, douehouſe, pond, poole, barne, mill, or ſtacke of corne, or to doe any other vnlawfull act with force and violence, and againſt the peace, and they doe it. If a man goe abroade with his houſhold ſeruants which he hath commonly of his owne familie (though they be more then his abilitie or degrée is to maintaine) and doth make a fray by the way, this is no Riot, vnleſſe the Maſter did before make his ſeruants priuy, that hée meant to make an affray: for it is no riot, except there be an intent before to doe ſome violence and hurt. If thrée, foure, or more doe enter into landes with force, vppon the poſſeſſion of an other, though their entrie be lawfull, yet is it a Riot,<note place="margin">St. 5.

            <p n="5">5 A Route is, where thrée perſons or aboue doe aſſemble themſelues,<note place="margin">What is a Rout.</note> for the reuenge of their owne common quarrell. As, if the Inhabitants of a Towne doe aſſemble together to pull downe a houſe, wall, pale, ditch, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incloſure, of a parke, paſture, or cloſe, or the head of a poole, where they wrongfully pretend to haue title of common, or a way, or to beate, or maihem one man, or more, that haue done to them all ſome publike offence.

And the plaintife muſt anſwer to that ſpeciall matter alledged in the barre, without anſwering to the Trauerſe of the force, and vpon that ſpeciall matter, the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue muſt be ioyned, and not vpon the force.

But if he make a title to the land by pleading in barre, as is aforeſaid, then it ſhalbe adiudged his owne folly.

And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment being remoued into the kings bench, and proces being awarded for the king againſt C. he appeared and pleaded to the force and armes, &amp; all that is againſt the peace, not guiltie. But the court enforced him to plead to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and then he iuſtified his entry by reaſon of a remainder intailed to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame land, and that his father entred and died ſeiſed thereof, &amp; that he as heire to his father did enter. And ſo it is, if a man be indited for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of certaine goods by force and armes, he ſhal anſwer to the taking, and if he be found guilty of the Treſpas, there ſhalbe no inquirie made of the force and armes.</p>

And therefore when one action is brought againſt ſeuerall Iurors, for taking of money to giue their verdict, euery of them muſt plead his plea ſeuerally,<note place="margin">21. H. 6. 20.</note> and by himſelfe. If a Iuror doe take money to giue his verdict on the one part, if after he doth giue no verdict, or if hee with his companions doe giue a true verdict, or ſuch a verdict as the party who bringeth the writ receiueth no hurt thereby, or if the plaintife be nonſute,<note place="margin">37. H. 6. 31.</note> yet a <hi>Decies tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> may bée brought againſt him: For it is not the giuing of the verdict which the Law doth reſpect, and puniſh, but the taking of the money to giue his verdict, and ſo to doe an vnlawfull act. But otherwiſe it is of an Embraceor, for if he take money to embrace, and yet doth not embrace, no action will lye againſt him: for he is no Embraceor, if he doe not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. In a writ of <hi>Decies tantum,</hi> if the Iury find,<note place="margin">41. E. 3. 9.</note> that one of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the former Iſſue did take land for fortie pounds leſſe then it was worth, to giue his verdict, the ſame Iuror ſhall forfeit to the King and the party tenne times ſo much, <hi>viz.</hi> foure hundred pounds. And ſo ſhall the Embraceor forfeit tenne times ſo much, if he hath the land for leſſe then it is worth, after the Iurie hath giuen their verdict by his meanes or perſuaſion. And the one moytie which is due to the King in this caſe, according to the foreſaid Statute of <hi>Anno</hi> 38. <hi>Edward.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">41. Ed. 3.15. Fitz. Decies tantum 12. 44.

Men that be learned in the Law, may for their fées ſpeake to the Iury,<note place="margin">6.

If he that is the party grieued, who may haue againſt any Iuror a <hi>Decies tantum</hi> for taking of money, doe releaſe to the ſame Iuror all actions, this will not auaile the ſame
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16540:65"/> Iuror, for by the ſaid ſtatute any perſon that will, being a ſtranger, may haue a <hi>Decies tantum</hi> againſt the ſame Iuror.

If after hée doe redéeme his Land, hée may ſell it, or Leaſe it within one yeare after, though he hath not béene in poſſeſſion thereof, nor taken the Rents or Profites thereof by the ſpace of many yeares before: For the meaning of the Statute is not to reſtraine the bargaining, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſelling of good and cleare Rights, but of pretended Righs and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.

And therefore if the particular tenant, during the continuance of his eſtate, doe commit any waſt in the ſame land, he cannot deliuer it againe at the end of his terme in ſuch plight and ſort, as at the firſt he did receiue and borrow it: but by the waſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall profit of the land is impaired, and therefore of ſo much in value, hée in the reuerſion or remainder is diſherited.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a priſoner is appealed, or indited of treaſon, or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie, and brought to the barre to be arraigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and his inditement is read vnto him, he is aſked by the Court what he will ſay vnto it: Then either hée doth confeſſe the offence, and the inditement to bée true: or he eſtrangeth himſelfe from the offence, and pleadeth, Not guiltie:<note place="margin">An offendour pleadeth one of thrée pleas.</note> or elſe hée doth anſwer indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo in effect he ſtandeth mute, and maketh no anſwer. Of the which later two I will intreate héereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And therefore beginning with the priſoners Confeſſion of the offence vpon his arraignement: That confeſſion may be made in two ſorts,<note place="margin">Confeſſion in two ſorts.</note> and to two ſeuerall ends, whereof the one is, he may confeſſe the offence whereof he is indited openly in the Court before the Iudge: and that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that act whereof he is indited and arraigned, and ſubmit himſelfe to the cenſure and iudgement of the Lawe. Which Confeſſion of the offence by the priſoner himſelfe in perſon, is the moſt aſſured anſwer, and beſt ſatiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that can be deliuered to the Iudge to condemne the offendour, and to all the hearers to giue approbation thereof: So that the ſaid Confeſſion do procéede fréely, and of his owne good will, without menace,<note place="margin">Confeſſion muſt be trée and without menace.</note> threats, rigor, or other extreamities: For if the Iudge doe perceiue that the offendors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion doth growe vpon either of thoſe extreamities, he ought not to record the confeſſion, but to cauſe the priſoner pleade to the offence, not guiltie. As, a woman was indited for the felonious ſtealing of bread to the value of two ſhillings,<note place="margin">27. Aſ. p. 40</note> and being arraigned thereof, ſhe confeſſed the felonie, and ſaide that ſhe did it by the commaundement of her huſband, and the Iudges for pitie would not record her confeſſion, but cauſed her to pleade, not guiltie to the felonie: whereupon a Iurie being charged, it was found that ſhe did ſteale the bread by the compulſion of her huſband, againſt her will, by which meanes ſhe was diſcharged. And in like ſort if the Iudges doe perceiue that the offendour doth confeſſe the offence in miſtaking of the Lawe, they may
<pb facs="tcp:16540:191"/> ſhew him that fauour, as not to record his confeſſion, but cauſe him to pleade to the inditement, not guiltie. As a man being indited of the death of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, pleaded, that he and one B. hauing a quarrell,<note place="margin">22. Aſ. p. 71</note> and fighting each with the other, the party of whoſe death he was indited, came betwéene them to part the fray, and he againſt his will, by miſfortune, gaue him a blowe, whereof hée died. For though by the Lawe this was felonie in him being fighting, and intending to hurt or kill B. yet he did miſtake the Lawe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and did not take it to be ſo, for that his quarrell was not towardes him which he ſlue, but to B. who had no hurt. And further, this confeſſion of the Offence is not ſo penall to the priſoner, (though he doth it fréely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out menace, or other extreamitie) that he is thereby preſently attainted or condemned of that felonie, but in many caſes he may be ſaued from death, the moſt bitter rigour of the Lawe, by the benefit of his cleargie, or by the Kings pardon.</p>

This triall in an appeale by battell ſhall be betwéene the appellant and the appellée themſelues, in their own perſons, and not by Champions (as it is in a writ of right.)

               <note place="margin">The reaſon why the def. may be tried by battel in appeale.</note>3 The reaſon why in an appeale the Defendant ſhall bée admitted to trie his cauſe by Battell is, for that no euident or probable matter doth appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to prooue him guiltie of the felonie whereof hée is appealed, but onely the bare accuſation of the Appellant, which is no witneſſe of credit in his owne cauſe. And therefore ſéeing the appellant doth demaund iudgement of death againſt the Appellée by an appeale, and hath no other probable eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to attaint him, but his owne accuſation, it is more reaſon, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant ſhall aduenture his life with the appellée for the triall thereof, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant doe require it, than to put the triall thereof vpon the countrey (which for default of euidence may be ignorant of the truth thereof, and ſo giue a falſe verdit) and by that meanes to leaue it to God (to whom the truth of all things be knowne) to giue the verdit in this cauſe, by attributing the victorie or vanquiſhment to which partie it ſhall pleaſe him.</p>

            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">Taken with the manoure.</note>5 If the Defendant be taken with the manoure (as in an appeale of death, with a bloodie knife, or other weapon) he ſhalbe barred from waging of battel. And ſo it ſhall be if he be taken with the manoure in an appeale of Robberie,<note place="margin">7. H. 4. 44 Fit. cor. 230 4.

Cor. 375</note> though the money cannot be knowne from other money. And the reaſons why in an appeale of robberie, the defendant being taken with the manoure, ſhall not wage battell againſt the appellant be, for that by the Appeale the plaintife doth endeauour to attaint the Appellée of felonie, and alſo to haue his goods againe. And it may be, that if it ſhould be tried by Battell, the Appellée might vanquiſh the Appellant in combate (though the appellee be guiltie of the felonie) and by that meanes alſo retaine his goods ſtollen, without cauſe.<note place="margin">Taken with the manoure.</note> And the manoure was accounted ſo pregnant an euidence in former ages, that the Iuſtices would as readily arraigne a priſoner vpon the manoure taken in his poſſeſſion, as vpon an indictment.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It is alſo a good counter-plea to the battell, for the Appellant to ſay,<note place="margin">Breaking of priſon.</note> that the defendant when he was taken or arreſted for that felonie whereof the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale is ſued,<note place="margin">Fi.

And the Appellée may reply to that counter-plea, and trauerſe the arreſt for felonie, or the breaking of the priſon, if he will, or he may plead the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the breaking of the priſon:<note place="margin">1.

He which had the priuiledge of his Clergie, and was deliuered to the Ordinarie that did demaund him, was not ſet at libertie, to goe wandring vp and downe the Countrie, but was ſafely and ſtraitly kept in the Biſhoppes priſon,<note place="margin">In what ſort a clerke deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the Ordinarie was vſed.</note> hauing for foode vppon the Sonday bread, ale, and peaſe, and vpon all the other daies, courſer bread, and ſmall drinke once in the day onely (or in the Kings priſon, if the Biſhop would haue it ſo) vntill hée had purged himſelfe of the crime wherewith hée was charged, or otherwiſe had failed of his purgation and could not make it. And if the Biſhop would not admitte him to make his purgation, then the King would direct his Writte to the Biſhoppe, commaunding him to ſuffer the ſame priſoner to make his purgation:<note place="margin">15. H. 7. 19.</note> or the King at his pleaſure might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the priſoner, or cauſe him to be ſet at libertie without making any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And when a Clerke was to make his purgation, the King was to be made priuie thereunto, who did direct his Writ to the Shirife of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie where the offendor was priſoner, commaunding him to make proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his Countie, that if any man could ſhew cauſe why ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, <hi>viz.</hi> A.

And if by the ſaide Enqueſt of Clerkes he was found not guilty of the ſame offence, then he was ſet at libertie: and if hée were found guiltie, he was diſgraded.</p>
            <p>There be two ſorts of Clerkes, whereof the one is a Clerke conuict, and the other is a Clerke attainted.

Cor. 417</note> And likewiſe, a Monke that was a Clerke conuict, ſhould haue béene deliuered to his Abbot, to haue remained in the Abbey continually, without making his purgation.<note place="margin">Fi.

A Clerke attainted<note place="margin">Clerke at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.</note> is he who praieth his Clergie after Iudgement of felonie giuen of him: Such a Clerke could not haue made his purgation, for that
<pb facs="tcp:16540:224"/> when he was condemned of felony by iudgement, hée could not contrarie to that Iudgement be purged thereof; that iudgement remaining in force: and therefore there was none other remedy for him, but to purchaſe the Kings pardon, or elſe hée muſt haue remained in priſon during his life.

And though, after his confeſſion of the felony, and before Iudgement giuen againſt him thereupon, he doth pray his Clergie, he ſhall haue it, and might haue made his purgation: for that the confeſſion being before a ſecular Iudge, who is not his Iudge, is voide.

And it is not to be interpreted that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Statute is to be extended onely to ſaue the approuers life, and not to ſet him at libertie by making his purgation, for then hée ſhould haue but part of the benefit of Clergie, and not the whole which is contrary to the ſaide Statute of <hi>Articuli Cleri:</hi> If an approuer had waiued his appeale, &amp; holden him to his Clergie; he ſhould haue made his purgation,<note place="margin">Fi.

As it is neceſſary for the Commonwealth, that Felons ſhould be puniſhed, leaſt the impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome ſhould incourage them, and alſo allure others to commit the like offences: ſo is it fit, that they chiefely, whoſe goods were taken from them, and therby haue taſted the ſmart, and receiued the loſſe by the Felons, and are more likely to know who they be, and where they be, then others are, ſhould doe their vttermoſt endeauor to procure thoſe Felons to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, brought to their anſwers, and to haue them puniſhed according to their demerits: that is to ſay, he that was robbed,<note place="margin">What is freſh ſuit.</note> or whoſe goods were ſtolne from him, ought preſently after the felony committed to purſue the Felon ſo haſtily, that (if it be poſſible) he may take him with the manoure, and thereupon bring his appeale againſt him,<note place="margin">Fi. Cor. 379.</note> and conuince him of the Felony. And the ſaid ſpéedy and diligent purſute of his, is called Freſh ſuit, which thing being found by a Iury, the king ought to make reſtitution to the appellant of his goods contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the appeale, which his officer or any other to his vſe did ſeize. But if it be not found by a Iury, that the owner did make Freſh ſuit, the ſaid owner ſhall looſe his goods, and the king ſhall haue them, although the Felon be conuict at the ſame parties ſuit. For as the Law doth ſo abhorre Felonies and Felons, that it puniſheth a Felon with the loſſe of his life, his lands, goods, and all that he hath: ſo doth it in ſuch ſort condemne the concealing, wincking at, or ſlacke purſute of a felon, that it puniſheth a true man with the forfeiture of his goods ſtolne from him, for omitting his duty in making freſh ſute after, proſecuting, and purſuing to death of a knowne Felon. If the manoure wherwith the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is taken be portable, or otherwiſe may be conueniently done, it ought to be brought into the Court before the Iuſtices: and if it be in a cheſt, boxe, cloake-bag,<note place="margin">Fi.

And if the Felon which committed a Robbery or other Felony be not taken by the ſpace of a yeare after the Felony committed, yet if the party that was robbed, or whoſe goods were ſtolne, do his endeuour to apprehend the Felon, and make diligent and ſpeciall inquiry for him, and after he is taken,<note place="margin">7.
